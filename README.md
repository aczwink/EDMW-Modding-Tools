EDMW uses "databases" to store configuration of units, buildings etc. Each database is a collection of objects. Objects can have fields and occasionally also subobjects.
The format of the databases is stored in the xml files in the "db" directory of this repository. The editor uses these in order to read the database files of the game and interpret the data accordingly.
